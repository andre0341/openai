Simple parser for travel offers with a small HTML interface. Assets are organized in `css/`, `js/` and `php/` folders.

After parsing the pasted HTML list you can sort and filter the extracted data. A dropdown appears with all the available regions and you can enable or disable them via checkboxes. The table shows 200 entries by default.
